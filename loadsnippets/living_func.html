        IKEA has the perfect furniture for every stage of a consumer’s life and explicitly markets itself with family values. In its annual catalogue, IKEA follows consumers in different life stages and explores each of their perfectly-furnished homes.     </p>

        The 2021 catalogue features a smart studio for a young food photographer who lives in a “home-meets-side-hustle hub,” a home of a young couple “starting out and living light”, and new parents who “turned their one-bedroom rental into a cozy family home.”  The young couple they feature, for instance, is accompanied by this image, which includes a closet that folds up and two bright surfboards, representing the couples’ adventurous, on-the-go spirit. The next picture is for a family with a young daughter, featuring a picture-perfect playroom with gingham wallpaper, a pegboard for storing homework, and a hopscotch rug.

        No matter where you are in life, they create a vision of an aspiration home, filled with perfectly “functional” furniture that inevitably must be switched out for new functional furniture as your life evolves. They paint an idyllic picture of growing up - from independent professional to a filled family - all through the lens of a vision for home. Even the layout of the store is also extra-accomodating to families, with the play area at the beginning of the store that parents can drop children off at before going shopping.

        The actions of IKEA are not always so family-friendly though. A 2016 audit found that IKEA managed to avoid an estimated sum of €1 billion in taxes over the course of 6 years by taking advantage of loopholes and shifting royalties through Liechtenstein, Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. Those one billion euros likely may have done more good for the everyday middle-class family than cheap furniture options. Furthermore, the IKEA founder Ingvar Kampard is widely admired throughout Sweden, but his past is troubling. Kamprad was an enthusiastic member of the Swedish Nazis in his youth and continued supporting Per Engdahl, a Swedish far-right politician, throughout his entire life. His fascist involvement trickled into his business as well, as he admitted to using forced labor of political prisoners in East Germany throughout the 1980s.
