    IKEA’s aesthetic can be described as an adoption and then bastardization of the Bauhaus architecture principle of ‘form follows function.’ For instance, this kitchen island, like most IKEA pieces, is built for convenience, giving extra counter space, storage, and utility. 
</p>
<p class="p-6 text-lg">
    This $548 kitchen island is certainly functional - it creates a space to hang kitchen tools, a place to store pots and bowls, and is the perfect height for matching kitchen stools. Is the optimal functionality of the hanging rack for the spatulas really more functional than the drawers and cabinets behind the island though? Is it necessary to have a kitchen island for sipping tea when the home presumably has a dining table that can have chairs on all four sides, rather than just the one? We make the argument that IKEA is creating function from form to promote consumerism.
</p>
<p class="p-6 text-lg">
    In fact, upon further consideration, the function of nearly everything in the store is meant to promote such consumerism. For example, the strategic placement of food in the middle of the shopping experience, to give consumers a pick-me-up and encourage them to stay in the store longer, as well as the cinnamon rolls at the end of the store to give consumers a more positive association with spending money at IKEA, all serve one function: to get consumers to buy more. While IKEA’s pillars appear to be affordability, simplicity, and optionality, these pillars only exist to further IKEA’s goal as a corporation to make as much profit as possible.
