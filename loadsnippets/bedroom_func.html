        IKEA has made company commitments to source cotton and wood sustainably, use more eco-friendly packaging, and use ethical labor. However, as a global corporation focused on reducing costs and increasing profits, many of IKEA’s practices inevitably fall short of sustainability.     
    </p>
    <p class="p-6 text-lg">
        In the same way that fast fashion is inherently unsustainable, even if it uses 85% recycled cotton, the culture of mass consumption that IKEA promotes is unsustainable. The throw that you bought for your bedroom, for instance, uses 100% sustainably sources cotton, which means that the cotton is either recycled, or grown with less water, chemical fertilizer and pesticide. “Less” water in the context of the massive amount of cotton IKEA uses and encourages consumers to buy, though, is still not environmental.
    </p>
    <p class="p-6 text-lg">
        IKEA’s resource footprint is massive. It single-handedly uses approximately 1 percent of the world’s wood supply and 1 percent of the world’s cotton supply each year. To help achieve its sustainable goals, IKEA bought an entire forest in Romania back in 2015, aiming to double sales but only increase wood usage by half. IKEA’s sustainable sourcing represents a complete disconnect with nature, where entire forests are maintained purely to be made into bookcases.

        Additionally, IKEA has faced continuous difficulties with ethical labor. On its face, IKEA has fully denounced the usage of child labor and emphasizes its impact on the global world, even partnering with organizations such as UNICEF and Save the Children to provide funding for the building of schools and educational materials to address the causes of child labor and to empower women. While these efforts are admirable, due to the globalized nature of production, it is often difficult for large corporations to realize when production they have outsourced is being carried out by child labor. A 2014 report, for instance, found that one of IKEA’s major suppliers used child labor in India, Pakistan, and Nepal. As long as IKEA continues to focus on finding the cheapest production possible, its initiatives to donate to global efforts to end child labor will be ineffective.

        IKEA has had a longstanding corporate commitment to environmental concerns, piloting an environmental plan in 1990 aligned with The Natural Step framework. Despite these initiatives, IKEA only decreased its supply chain-wide carbon emissions for the first time in 2020, which they attributed to the increased use of renewable energy. It is clear that IKEA will always prioritize profits first, and sustainability second, which is why their carbon emissions increased year after year for three decades after their first environmental plan.
